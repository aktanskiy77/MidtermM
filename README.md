1. Difference between switch and checkout
git switch: This command is specifically used to switch between branches. It's more user-friendly and helps prevent mistakes by not mixing functionalities.
git checkout: This command can switch branches but also allows you to checkout specific commits or files, making it more versatile but potentially more complex.

2. What does git merge do?
git merge combines the changes from one branch into another. It takes the commits from the source branch and integrates them into the target branch, creating a new merge commit if necessary.

3. What happens to the commit history after rebase and why?
After a rebase, the commit history is rewritten. The commits from the rebased branch are reapplied on top of another branch, which results in a linear history. This makes the project history cleaner but can complicate things if the original branch is shared with others.

4. How to understand which branch is remote and which is local in the terminal?
In the terminal, remote branches are typically prefixed with the remote name, such as origin/branch-name, while local branches appear as just branch-name. You can list branches with git branch -a, which shows both local and remote branches. Remote branches will be listed under the "remotes" section.
